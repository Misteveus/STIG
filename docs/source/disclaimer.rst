==========
- Structured Threat Intelligence Graph (STIG) is open sourced for the purpose of providing a repeatable and sharable platform for structured threat information.  The California Energy Systems for the 21st Century (CES-21) program funded by the California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) created many capabilities to meet the connected nature of the electric grid for the State of California.  The CPUC has granted permission to release STIG to the open source community to promote potential uses beyond CES-21.
- STIG does not assess the quality of threat information.  The quality of the threat information gathered and modified is based on the source of that threat information.
- STIG does not provide executable detection and response.  STIG output may be used in other detection and response technologies if those technologies digest Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX) 2.0.  Integration with other detection and response technologies is not part of STIG.
- STIG can support extensions to the STIX data structures with the creation of a new database instance to include those structures.  These STIX extensions may not be supported in other STIX compliant technologies.
- Advanced programming scripts can be created or may exist inside a STIX data object that is represented in the STIG views and database.  These scripts are not tested through STIG or STIX validation.  These scripts, if used, are to be integrated at the implementerâ€™s risk.
